Project Goal: Personal Finance Tracker

The objective of this project is to develop a Python program that enables users to effectively manage their finances. The program will allow users to:

Create an Account: Users can sign up for an account to securely store their financial data.
Upload Income: Users can input multiple income sources, making it easy to track earnings.
Track Expenses: Users can record their expenses to monitor spending patterns and manage their money effectively.
Set Savings Goals: Users can establish savings targets based on their financial objectives. They will have the flexibility to determine how much to save within specific intervals (e.g., weekly, monthly).
Visualize Finances: The application will generate graphs to illustrate income, expenses, savings progress, and overall financial health.
Weekly Goals: Users can set and track weekly financial goals to encourage better spending and saving habits.
